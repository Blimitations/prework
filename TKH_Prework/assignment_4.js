//Now create a loop that compares the array of numbers provided for the number 25, console log "over" if it is "over" and under if it is under over_under_array = [1,45,32,21,5,17,43,93] This solution should be saved in your pre-work directory you created earlier in the file://



const over_under_array = [1,45,32,21,5,17,43,93] 


for(let i=0; i<over_under_array.length; i++){

  if(i>25){
      console.log("over")
    
  }else if(i<25){console.log("under")}

}
